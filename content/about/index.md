TIL is short for "Today I Learned". This site is a bunch of notes on what I've been learning, and they're written without the constraints of trying to be thorough or profound. These posts might be helpful to others, but it's okay if they aren't. This was inspired by [Simon Willison's TILs](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/) and [a great HN discussion about writing](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37118883).

I also have a [blog](https://wheelercj.github.io/notes/). You can reach me at mail@chriswheeler.dev or on [GitHub](https://github.com/wheelercj).
