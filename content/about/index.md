TIL is short for "Today I Learned". This site is a bunch of notes on what I've been learning, but they're not necessarily posted the same day I learn what they cover. These notes might be helpful to others, but it's okay if they're only helpful to me. This was partly inspired by [Simon Willison's TILs](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/) and [a great HN discussion about writing](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37118883).

I also have a [blog](https://chriswheeler.dev/) that I sometimes [redirect](https://til.chriswheeler.dev/customizing-a-hugo-theme/#redirecting) notes to from here after I add enough to them. You can reach me on [GitHub](https://github.com/wheelercj) or by my email, which ends with `chriswheeler.dev` and starts with `mail@`.
