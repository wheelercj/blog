Goals should be as specific as possible in terms of the what, when, why, and how of each goal.

* Specific — Can you break the goal down into smaller goals?
* Measurable — How will you track your progress? Make sure it will feel to you like you are making progress when you are.
* Attainable — What are the odds you will reach your goal? Think realistically about your abilities, and be prepared to make changes gradually instead of all at once.
* Relevant — How does this goal connect to your long-term plans?
* Time-bounded — When will you start, when will you finish, and/or what days and times will you schedule to work on this goal?

> Keep yourself accountable. To ensure that you stick to the goals you set, it is important to make a concrete, specific plan for how you will keep yourself accountable.  A friend or trusted colleague can help with this.  For example, knowing that a colleague will be asking you about your progress may give you an incentive to complete your goal. -- [sciencecareers.org](https://myidp.sciencecareers.org/CareerAdvancementGoals/QuickTips)
