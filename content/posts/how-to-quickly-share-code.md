Sending entire files can be problematic sometimes. Here are other options.
You can either use a code block (see below), or a website designed for quickly sharing code:

1. Go to [bpa.st](https://bpa.st/) or [mystb.in](https://mystb.in/)
2. Paste your code
3. Click the paste button in the bottom-left corner
4. Copy the new URL of the site
5. Send the URL

## code blocks

If you want to send code somewhere markdown is supported (such as Discord), use a code block.

\`\`\`cpp  
cout << "Enter a number: ";  
int num;  
cin >> num;  
cout << "\nYou entered " << num;  
\`\`\`  

Typing the above will be rendered as:

```cpp
cout << "Enter a number: ";
int num;
cin >> num;
cout << "\nYou entered " << num;
```
