* Just get started.
    * You don't have to do a lot right now.
    * It doesn't have to be perfect.
    * If you _really_ don't feel like starting, then count to ten while relaxing and then start.
    * If you need to do something that will take only two minutes or less, do it right away.
* Set a timer. Consider using the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).
* Set deadlines for yourself before the real deadlines, if you can afford to. "Work expands to fill the time that we allocate to it." â€” Parkinson's Law
* At the start of each day, ask yourself, "What do I need to get done to feel satisfied with what I've accomplished at the end of the day?"
* Create [SMART goals](/smart-goals)
* Focus completely on working or resting; never compromise. Nobody is good at multitasking.
* Make gradual changes to your routine because willpower is like a muscle. It can get worn out and it can be strengthened with practice.
