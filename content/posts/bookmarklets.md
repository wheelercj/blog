Bookmarklets are bookmarks in a browser, but rather than navigating to a website when clicked, they run some JavaScript on a page. They can do a wide variety of things to a website such as change fonts, search for phone numbers, remove all images, . . . they can do just about anything JavaScript can do, which is a lot.
