Here are a bunch of tools I found for reading, editing, and more with PDFs. Of these, I have so far used Sumatra PDF, Xodo (their downloadable version), and OCRmyPDF, but the others look promising.

* [Sumatra PDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader) is the best PDF reader for Windows.
* [Xodo](https://xodo.com/) has an online and downloadable PDF editor.
* [SimplePDF](https://simplepdf.eu/) is an online PDF editor.
* [OCRmyPDF](https://github.com/ocrmypdf/OCRmyPDF) performs optical character recognition (OCR) to add a text layer to PDFs, making them searchable, among other benefits.
* [pydigitize](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30615279) uses OCRmyPDF and other tools to convert paper documents to PDFs ready for archival.
* [PDF-Diff](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32353479) is for visualizing the differences between two PDFs.
* [PDF Annotator](https://pdf-annotator.repeat.day/) is for signing and annotating PDFs.
* [PDFTool](https://www.pdftool.org/en) is a collection of tools for encrypting, decrypting, optimizing, rotating, splitting, merging, removing, signing, and OCRing PDFs.
* [Stirling-PDF](https://github.com/Stirling-Tools/Stirling-PDF) is a locally hosted (with Docker) collection of PDF manipulation tools including for splitting, merging, converting, reorganizing, adding images, rotating, compressing, and more.
* [Bank Statement Converter](https://bankstatementconverter.com/) converts PDF bank statements to Excel's XLS format, though most banks let you export CSV files.
* [PrintFriendly](https://www.printfriendly.com/) converts many file formats to PDF for better printing.
* [PrintWhatYouLike.com](https://www.printwhatyoulike.com/) lets you print the good parts of any web page while skipping ads and other junk.
* [this HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39027543) covers several tools that can be used to generate PDFs using HTML and CSS.
