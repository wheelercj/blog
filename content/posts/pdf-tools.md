Here are a bunch of tools I found for reading, editing, and more with PDFs. Of these, I have so far used Sumatra PDF, Xodo (their downloadable version), and OCRmyPDF, but the others look promising.

* [Sumatra PDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader) is the best PDF reader for Windows.
* [Xodo](https://xodo.com/) has an online and downloadable PDF editor.
* [SimplePDF](https://simplepdf.eu/) is an online PDF editor.
* [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) converts files between many formats.
* [OCRmyPDF](https://github.com/ocrmypdf/OCRmyPDF) performs optical character recognition (OCR) to add a text layer to PDFs, making them searchable, among other benefits.
* [Marker](https://github.com/vikparuchuri/marker) converts PDF to markdown, optionally using OCRmyPDF.
* [pydigitize](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30615279) uses OCRmyPDF and other tools to convert paper documents to PDFs ready for archival.
* [PDF-Diff](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32353479) is for visualizing the differences between two PDFs.
* [PDF Annotator](https://pdf-annotator.repeat.day/) is for signing and annotating PDFs.
* [PDFTool](https://www.pdftool.org/en) is a collection of in-browser tools for encrypting, decrypting, optimizing, rotating, splitting, merging, OCRing, removing, and signing PDFs.
* [PDFEquips](https://www.pdfequips.com) is a collection of online tools for encrypting, decrypting, compressing, rotating, splitting, merging, OCRing, rearranging, converting, numbering, translating, and watermarking PDFs. Its file converters work with many file types. According to its creator, "The files [on the server] are deleted immediately after processing" ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40337933#40340313#40338727:~:text=the%20files%20are%20deleted%20immediately%20after%20processing)).
* [Stirling-PDF](https://github.com/Stirling-Tools/Stirling-PDF) is a locally hosted (with Docker) collection of PDF manipulation tools including for splitting, merging, converting, reorganizing, adding images, rotating, compressing, and more.
* [Bank Statement Converter](https://bankstatementconverter.com/) converts PDF bank statements to Excel's XLS format, though most banks let you export CSV files.
* [PrintFriendly](https://www.printfriendly.com/) converts many file formats to PDF for better printing.
* [PrintWhatYouLike.com](https://www.printwhatyoulike.com/) lets you print the good parts of any web page while skipping ads and other junk.
* [this HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39027543) covers several tools that can be used to generate PDFs using HTML and CSS.
