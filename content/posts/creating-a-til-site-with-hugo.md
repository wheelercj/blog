What this site is and my reasons for creating it are on [the about page](/about). This is my first time using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and I am very impressed. I used Jekyll once a long time ago and the experience convinced me to make [my own static site generator](https://github.com/wheelercj/Aurora). Now it's been a few years, and I'm going to stop using it because it runs a little slow and is annoying to maintain since it's written in Python. In hindsight, I also made many mistakes on that project and didn't get around to fix them, but at least I learned a lot from that project and since then.

There are many Hugo themes to choose from. While quickly scrolling through [the site listing them](https://themes.gohugo.io/), here are the ones that caught my eye for my purposes:

* [etch](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/etch/)
* [tailwind](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-tailwind/)
* [blog-awesome](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-blog-awesome/)
* [compost](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/compost/)
* [bearcub](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-bearcub/)
* [anubis](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-anubis/)
* [flat](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-flat/)
* [lekh](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/lekh/)
* [salinger](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/salinger-theme/)
* [cupper](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/cupper-hugo-theme/)
* [bare](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/bare-hugo-theme/)

I've decided to use Etch for now, but I might modify it later to also show each post's tags on the index page. The site looks a little better when [Dark Reader](https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader) is disabled. Maybe I'll change that later too.

I'm following Hugo's guide for how to [Host on GitHub Pages](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/).

Although this is the first post intended for this site, til.chriswheeler.dev, I will probably add some older notes with their original dates.
