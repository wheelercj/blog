* Change your environment to make the habit easier to follow.
* Try to make the habit satisfying.
* Make your habit changes gradual so you don't burn yourself out.
* When building a new habit, think about the impact it will have in the long term rather than the short term. Relate your habits to your identity. "We are what we repeatedly do." — Will Durant
* "Discipline equals freedom" — Jocko Willink
